# Yacht-Club
A yacht club created to handle boats and register members.  
  
This was a task done whilst studying at the Linneaus University, taking a course in Object Oriented Programming.  
This task has evolved my programming to the next level, by teaching me the beauty of OOP.  
  
At first it was tricky and seemed pointless, but as I progressed in developing it. I grew more and more fond of it and understood more and more.  
  
And right now I feel like there is no way to go back. I've learned so much overall from doing this task.

# The way it works
It provides you with a simple user interface as a console based application.  
The menu itself will help you navigate to the specific tasks.  
Finally when you're done, it will write to a data.xml file, in which stores all the members and boats of the Yacht Club.
